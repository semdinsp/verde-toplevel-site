We are looking to provide a complete solution for recycling with our partners MDF and Caltech.  We envision collecting waste plastic from all over DIli  (Timor Plaza is evaluating our proposal).  We would provide this to Caltech who will manufacture plastic bricks.  We will jointly team up to build affordable rent to own housing with Kick Starter funnding from outsite partners.  We hope to provide housing for 50-100 per month where at the end of the lease period the renter would own the property.

Our vision is to create a complete value chain for the recycling business which is currently missing (there is no production level purchaser of recycled products in Timor and we hope our housing initiative will jump start this business)
