## Establishment of Coffee Exports

We have been working with a renown Timorese coffee producer to assist in coffee exports.  We continue to work opportunities to export green and roasted beans.  Feel free to [contact us](/contact) for pricing and delivery timetables.

We are committed to support the business development by covering costs to secure the appropriate export licenses and working with local brokers.  We are also trying to employ women in meaningful work.
